Background Knowledge:

When you send a sequence of bits (message) from one point to another on a datalink, you want to know that the message arrived correctly. A common form of insurance is to use an error detection scheme. Commonly used error detection approaches include CRC, Checksum, and Parity Check.

Cyclic redundancy check or CRC is a commonly used error detecting code. An X-bit CRC has the mathematical property of detecting all errors that occur in X or fewer consecutive bits, for any length of message. A single CRC can be associated with a large block of data, with a consequent savings in communications bandwidth.

Checksum is another approach of detecting errors in data transmission. One simple version is one-byte version of checksum. As an example, the ASCII number of ‚ÄòEE450‚Äô is [69, 69, 52, 53, 48]. The one-byte checksum method will sum these numbers, divide it by 256. As a result, the remainder(R) is 35 and quotient(Q) is 1. Add Q to R and then take 1‚Äôs complement of that number which is same as subtracting it from 255. Thus, the one-byte version of internet checksum is 219. If the sum (Q+R) exceeds 255, then divide the sum (Q+R) by 256 and get new quotient Q‚Äô and remainder R‚Äô, then adding Q‚Äô to R‚Äô, take 1‚Äôs complement of the number to get the one-byte version of internet checksum. Once some errors happen,

‚ÄòEE450‚Äô changes to ‚ÄòE?450‚Äô which corresponds to [69, 33, 52, 53, 48]. Suppose the checksum does not change, the receiver proceeds the similar process. The receiver finds the resulting checksum (0) mismatch with the checksum (219) received. It decides not to accept that data.

Two-dimensional (2D) parity check is also a powerful error detecting method. One simple version is onebyte version of 2D parity check. As is shown in Figure 1, the original data is segmented into bytes, i.e., 8 bits blocks. A parity value is computed for each row and for each column. In the transmitter side, each row parity is concatenated at the end of the corresponding byte, and the column parties are attached to the end of the transmitting data. In the receiver side, the data will be divided into blocks with 9 bits and check both the row parities and the column parities. The parity of both the column and the row containing the flipped bit will be detected.

Figure 1. Two-dimensional even parity code

Problem Statement:

In this project, you are required to implement and evaluate the performance of the three types of error detection approaches. We will simulate the process of sending data, transmitting data with errors introduced, and receiving the data with error detection.

The workflow is:

1. Read data to be sent from the given data file.

2. Calculate and the check codes (CRC, Checksum, Parity) for each data.

3. Append the check codes to the data following the corresponding rules.

4. Introduce the random bits error (given in the data file).

5. Check the received polluted data using the three error detection approaches.

6. Print whether the received data would be accepted (pass) or not (not pass).

Data File

We provide a data.txt file that includes the data to be sent and the errors introduced during transmitting. Each line includes a binary data and the error bits, separated by a space, examples are shown below.

10011010110101111100001100 000010000010000000000010000010

01011100111010110101111000 100010000000000100000101000000 ‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶

Note that the error bits are introduced to the sending codeword, rather than the original data. This means you should first process the binary data with check codes (adding CRC, checksum, or parity), then introduce the errors.

To introduce the random bits error, do XOR operation to the codeword: if it is 0, there is no error at the position; if it is 1, the bit of the codeword will be flipped. We will apply left alignment for the error bits with the codeword, meaning that comparison starts from the leftmost bit of both the codeword and the error bit, and the error introducing process stops if either one reaches the end.

How errors will be introduced:

Codeword: 10011010110101111100001100

Error bit: 000010000010000000000010000010

Codeword with errors (left alignment): 10010010111101111100000100

Part 1: CRC

In this project, you are required to implement and evaluate the performance of two types of CRC codes:

CRC-8 and CRC-16.

CRC-8 generator: x8+x5+x4+1= 1 0011 0001

CRC-16 generator: x16+x12+x5+1 = 1 0001 0000 0010 0001

You need to calculate and print out the CRC remainder pattern for transmitting the codeword. Then the receiver will print out the decision whether the received data should be accepted (Pass) or not (Not pass).

Data:0011001111110010010001010110110100001010111100111100010011111100

Error:000000000000001100000000000000000000000000000000001100000000000000000000

CRC-8

CRC: 11111100; Result: Not Pass

CRC-16

CRC: 1111011011001111; Result: Not Pass

Part2: Checksum

Using one-byte version of checksum, you are required to calculate and print the checksum value in binary. Then, after introducing errors to the transmitting codeword, print out the decision result of error detection using checksum.

Checksum

Checksum: 01100111; Result: Not Pass

Part3: Parity2D

Using one-byte version of 2D parity check, you are required to calculate and print the column parity and row parity. In input data are all 64-bit, leading to eight 8-bit blocks. We will calculate the column parity first and get the 8-bit parity for each raw data blocks. Then, we will consider the column parity as an extra row and calculate the row parity for all the 9 blocks, leading to a 9-bit row parity. You should print the column and row parities in the following format, then print out the decision result of error detection for the receiving polluted data using 2D parity check.

2D Parity

Col: 00101000; Row: 011100100; Result: Pass

Assumptions:

If you need to have more code files than the ones that are mentioned here, please use meaningful names and all small letters and mention them all in your README file.

Requirements:

1. Your programs should terminate itself after all done.

2. All the naming conventions and the on-screen messages must conform to the previously mentioned rules.

3. All the on-screen messages must conform exactly to the project description. You should not add anymore on-screen messages. If you need to do so for the debugging purposes, you must comment out all the extra messages before you submit your project.

Programming platform and environment:

1. All your submitted code MUST work well on the provided virtual machine (Ubuntu 20.04 or Ubuntu 22.04).

3. Your submission MUST have a Makefile. Please follow the requirements in the following

‚ÄúSubmission Rules‚Äù section.

Programming languages and compilers:

You must use only C/C++ on UNIX.

You can use a unix text editor like emacs or gedit to type your code and then use compilers such as g++ (for C++) and gcc (for C) that are already installed on Ubuntu to compile your code. You must use the following commands and switches to compile yourfile.c or yourfile.cpp. It will make an executable by the name of ‚Äúyourfileoutput‚Äù.

gcc -o yourfileoutput yourfile.c

g++ -o yourfileoutput yourfile.cpp

Do NOT forget the naming conventions mentioned before!

Submission Rules:

Along with your code files, include a README file and a Makefile. Submissions without README and Makefile will be subject to a penalty.

1. Files your need to submit includes: a source code file, a head file (if applicable), a Makefile, and README. Do not submit the given data.txt file. We will test on a different dataset.

2. Compress all your files including the README file into a single ‚Äútar ball‚Äù and call it: ee450_PA1_yourUSCusername.tar.gz. Please make sure that your name matches the one in the class list. Here are the instructions:

a. On your VM, go to the directory which has all your project files. Remove all executable and other unnecessary files. Only include the required source code (head) files, Makefile and the README file.

b. Use these commands in the terminal to compress your files into a tar ball: tar cvf ee450_PA1_yourUSCusername.tar * gzip ee450_PA1_yourUSCusername.tar

Now, you will find a file named ‚Äúee450_PA1_yourUSCusername.tar.gz‚Äù in the same directory. Please notice there is a space and a star(*) at the end of first command.

c. Do NOT include anything not required in your tar.gz file. Do NOT use subfolders. Any

compressed format other than .tar.gz will NOT be graded!

4. After receiving the confirmation email, please confirm your submission by downloading and compiling it on your machine. If the outcome is not what you expected, try to resubmit, and confirm again. We will only grade what you submitted even though it‚Äôs corrupted.

Grading Criteria:

Notice: We will only grade what is already done by the program instead of what will be done.

Your project is graded for 100 points and your grade will depend on the following:

1. Correct functionality.

2. Inline comments in your code. This is important as this will help in understanding what you have done.

3. Whether your programs work as you say they would in the README file.

4. If your submitted codes, cannot be compiled, you will receive 10 out of 100 for the project.

5. If your submitted codes compile using make but when executed, produce runtime errors without performing any tasks of the project, you will receive 15 out of 100 for the project.

7. Do not submit datafile used for test, otherwise, you will lose 5 points.

8. The minimum grade for an on-time submitted project is 10 out of 100, assuming there are no compilation errors and the submission includes a working Makefile and a README.

9. There are no points for the effort or the time you spend working on the project or reading the tutorial. If you spend about 2 weeks on this project and it doesn‚Äôt even compile, you will receive only 10 out of 100.

Cautionary Words:

In view of what is a recurring complaint near the end of a project, we want to make it clear that the target platform on which the project is supposed to run is the provided Ubuntu. It is strongly recommended that students develop their code on this virtual machine. In case students wish to develop their programs on their personal machines, possibly running other operating systems, they are expected to deal with technical and incompatibility issues (on their own) to ensure that the final project compiles and runs on the requested virtual machine. If you do development on your own machine, please leave at least three days to make it work on Ubuntu. It might take much longer than you expect because of some incompatibility issues.

All students are expected to write all their code on their own.
